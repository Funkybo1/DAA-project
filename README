The University Bus Route Management System is designed to optimize and streamline campus transportation by providing students and faculty with the most efficient bus routes, real-time arrival estimates, and seat allocation. Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm, the system determines the shortest route to a user’s destination, ensuring minimal travel and wait times.

Key Features
Shortest Route Calculation: Implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the most optimal bus route.

Real-Time Tracking: Live bus location updates for accurate arrival time estimation.

Seat Allocation System: Prevents overcrowding by managing bus seat reservations.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.

Performance Optimization: Ensures quick responses even under high user load.

Technology Stack
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js

Frontend: React.js / HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL

Algorithm Used: Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path computation

Real-Time Data: GPS integration for live bus tracking

Future Enhancements
AI-powered route prediction based on historical traffic patterns

IoT-based GPS tracking for enhanced accuracy

Mobile app support with push notifications

Smart card integration for seamless bus fare payments

Multi-language support for improved accessibility

This system provides a scalable, efficient, and intelligent solution to campus transportation challenges, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free commuting experience for students and faculty.
